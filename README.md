# FreqvsBayes

## About
So far, I have been using R for statistcal test and models, but am interested in how they are implemented in Python. Here, I will create some notebooks for the standard statistical tests in Python and also compare them with their Bayesian counterpart using PyMC3. These will included the T test, regression and GLM.
